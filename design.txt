<h3>DESIGN</h3>

Architect and designer Tarik Cumimbhoy combines both Old World Indian
artistry and modern elegance with his use of natural elements throughout the 
entire space. As a grand entrance  front facade and verstibule are composed
of hand-chiseled ribbons of concave, convex designs carved from blocks of
black Indian limestone that have been hand-brushed into a silky finish. As one
enters they find  abstract painting of the "Tree of Life" by artist Dolly Unithan,
the tree of life being thematic design focus of the restaurant.


The highlight of the restaurant is the Junoon Walk, a 50-foot walkway of a
Corten steel basin crafted by sculptor Michael Tong. The walk contains a 
sequence of eight foot tall "Tree of Life" sandstone sculptures that divides
into two dining rooms. To the right is the jaipur room, framed by 200 year-old
hand-carved  arch from a palace in Jaipur India. Decorated with Burmese
teak wooden tables this room discretely overlooks the bustling main dining
room in the left. The main dining room is delicately lit with Gold Sail lighting
from designer Ingo Maurer. This soft lighting with the neutral tones of fabric
walls offers every table a relaxing view of the open kitchen to catch a glimpse
of the Junoon culinary team hard at work.


The lounge is comprise of front walls made of  ribbons of limestone.Soft cork
flooring and crosscut wood walls set warm tones for intimate seating of steam
bend wood furniture. Enhanced by hand-carved antique Jhoola swings of
Burmese teak remodeled into glass top spice tables and lounge tables fabrics.
